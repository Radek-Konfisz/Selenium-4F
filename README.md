# Automated tests for a 4F website in Java Selenium
## Objective
A demo project showing the skills of using Selenium Web Driver with Java
## Project structure:
- Test plan: [Test_plan.yaml](src/test/resources/Test_plan.yaml)
- Test Cases: [Test_Cases.json](src/test/resources/Test_Cases.json)
- Pages: [pages](src/test/java/rk/_4f/pages)
- Tests: [tests](src/test/java/rk/_4f/tests)

## Summary and evaluation
The project is based on my previous professional work but in a much more limited form. 
The goal was to create a project from scratch in just a few days, incorporating as many elements of a real project as I was able to. 
I'm happy with the result. The next step will be to add Gherkin grammar using Cucumber. 
But first I'd like to focus on the Playwright project for the Blizzard API.

## Notes
Before running the tests, fill in email and password in [config.properties](src/test/resources/config.properties) file
